# Testing

In this folder, you have to add atleast one file - `Testing.md`.  Here you will pass instructions to the Prototyping Lab about functional, and other kinds of testing for your prototype. See some examples of this file on [the docs page](https://landr-balena-io-hardware-repo-hardware-process.netlify.app/docs/add-testing-instructions)
